Content management is at the heart of any successful website. In this post, we'll explore how Hugo handles content and how you can organize your content for maximum effectiveness.

## Content Organization

Hugo uses a simple directory structure to organize content. Each content file is stored in the `content` directory, often organized into subdirectories representing sections of your site.

## Front Matter

Front matter is metadata about your content, written in YAML, TOML, or JSON at the top of your content files. It can include:

- Title and description
- Publication date
- Tags and categories
- Draft status
- Custom parameters

## Page Bundles

Hugo supports page bundles, which allow you to group content files with associated assets like images and documents. This makes it easy to keep everything related to a piece of content in one place.

By mastering these content management techniques, you'll be able to create and maintain rich, organized websites with Hugo.
