This is a test post to demonstrate the improved list styling.

## Unordered List Example

Here's an example of an unordered list with our improved styling:

- First item in the list
- Second item with some more text to show how it wraps properly
- Third item with a nested list:
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
- Fourth item to complete the list

## Ordered List Example

Here's an example of an ordered list with standard numbering:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step with additional details
3. Third step that includes a nested list:
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two
4. Final step to complete the process

## Mixed List Example

You can also mix ordered and unordered lists:

- First main point
- Second main point with subpoints:
  1. First subpoint
  2. Second subpoint
- Third main point to conclude

The improved list styling removes default bullets and replaces them with larger, better-aligned blue arrows that match the site's color scheme.
