Once you've built your Hugo site, you'll need to deploy it to share it with the world. In this post, we'll cover various deployment options and best practices.

## Deployment Options

There are numerous ways to deploy your Hugo site:

- Traditional web hosts that support static files
- Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- Specialized static site hosting services like Netlify or Vercel
- GitHub Pages for open source projects

## Automated Deployments

Setting up automated deployments can save you time and reduce errors. Many hosting providers offer continuous deployment integrations with Git repositories.

## Performance Optimization

Before deploying, consider optimizing your site:

- Minify CSS and JavaScript files
- Optimize images
- Enable compression
- Use a CDN for global distribution

Following these deployment strategies will ensure your Hugo site reaches your audience quickly and reliably.
