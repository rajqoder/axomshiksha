description = "Isaac Asimov's science fiction novel The Fun They Had examines how education will develop in the future. It depicts a society in which kids use computer displays and mechanical teachers to learn by themselves at home. The narrative contrasts traditional schools with human teachers and classrooms with contemporary digital learning through Margie and Tommy. The narrative emphasises the value of friendship, personal connection, and joy in learning and serves as a reminder to readers that education is about more than just technology—it's also about fun and shared experiences."

**Ans:** Tommy says that, old kind of teachers were not a regular i.e. a mechanical teacher, they were human, who taught lessons to children of a class in a classroom and gave homeworks.

## IV. Answer each of these questions in two or three paragraphs (100–150 words).

### 1. What are the main features of the mechanical teachers and the schoolrooms that Margie and Tommy have in the story?

**Ans:** Margie and Tommy have machine teachers; they are machines shaped as robots and inserted into houses. The machine teachers teach on a display screen, ask queries, train students on homework, and conduct tests on students. The machine teachers have been adjusted according to the learning capacity of the students and are serviced by inspectors if they fault.

The classrooms for these children consist of small rooms within their homes, close to where they sleep. Each one learns alone, never with other children or with any human instructor. They can access lessons at any set time of the day, according to an extremely clever timetable.

Overall, a future with mechanical teachers and schoolrooms depicts a scene filled with efficiency but devoid of warmth, friendship, and fun.

### 2. Why did Margie hate school? Why did she think the old kind of school must have been fun?

**Ans:** Margie did not like school since she had a mechanical teacher who provided her with regular tests and homework. She did her work alone in a small room adjacent to her bedroom, in the absence of classmates and a human teacher. She particularly did not like geography the lessons were too fast and she continued to score poor marks. The school routine was strict and boring, which made learning unpleasant for her.

Margie believed that the old type of school must have been entertaining as children were learning in one school building. They were able to converse, play and assist each other during learning. Lessons were friendlier and interesting due to the presence of human teachers. She would envision kids laughing and having fun in school and this made her believe that the old schools were more joyful and fun than hers.

### 3. Do you agree with Margie that schools today are more fun than the school in the story? Give reasons for your answer.

**Ans:** Yes, I agree with Margie that schools today are more enjoyable than the one described in the story. Schools today allow all students to learn together in classrooms, making learning interactive and fun. Students can discuss the lessons, ask questions freely, and help each other, which enhances understanding. Activities such as playing games, group work, sports, and cultural programs make school life vibrant and interesting.

Teachers today are human, so they understand students’ feelings and difficulties in learning. They can explain lessons in different ways and motivate them with encouragement. In contrast, Margie’s school is lonely and mechanical, without friends or human interaction. Studying alone with a machine makes learning boring and stressful. Therefore, schools today are not only places of learning but also of friendship, enjoyment, and overall development.

## Thinking about Language  
### I. Adverbs

Read this sentence taken from the story:  
> They had once taken Tommy’s teacher away for nearly a month because the
history sector had blanked out completely.

The word **complete** is an adjective. When you add -ly to it, it becomes an adverb.

1. Find the sentences in the lesson which have the adverbs given in the box below.

{{< flex gap="1rem" marginY="1rem" flex="initial" >}}

{{< content-box marginY="1rem" content="awfully&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrowfully&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completely&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loftily&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differently&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonchalantly" ariaLabel="Adverbs box" >}}

{{< /flex >}}

2. **Now use these adverbs to fill in the blanks in the sentences below.**

**(i)** The report must be read {{< underscored-space>}} so that performance can be improved.  

**Ans:** The report must be read **carefully** so that performance can be improved.  

**(ii)** At the interview, Sameer answered our questions {{< underscored-space >}}, shrugging his shoulders.  

**Ans:** At the interview, Sameer answered our questions **nonchalantly**, shrugging his shoulders.  

**(iii)** We all behave {{< underscored-space>}}  when we are tired or hungry.  

**Ans:** We all behave **awfully** when we are tired or hungry.  

**(iv)** The teacher shook her head {{< underscored-space>}} when Ravi lied to her.  

**Ans:** The teacher shook her head **sorrowfully** when Ravi lied to her.  

**(v)** I {{< underscored-space>}} forgot about it.  
**Ans:** I  **quickly** forgot about it.  

**(vi)** When I complimented Revathi on her success, she just smiled {{< underscored-space>}}  and turned away.  

**Ans:** When I complimented Revathi on her success, she just smiled **loftily** and turned away.  

**(vii)** The President of the Company is {{< underscored-space>}} busy and will not be able to meet you.

**Ans:** The President of the Company is **completely** busy and will not be able to meet you.

**(viii)** I finished my work {{< underscored-space>}} so that I could go out to play.

**Ans:** I finished my work **quickly** so that I could go out to play.

> Remember:  
> An adverb describes action. You can form adverbs by adding -ly to adjectives.  
> Spelling Notes: When an adjective ends in **-y**, the **y** changes to **i** when you add -ly to form an adverb.  
> For example: angr-**y** --> angr-**i**-ly

3. Make adverbs from these adjectives.

{{< flex direction="column" gap="1rem" flex="initial" >}}

{{< flex gap="1.5rem" flex="initial" >}}
<span>(i) angry {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
<span>(ii) happy {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
{{< /flex >}}

{{< flex gap="1.5rem" flex="initial" >}}
<span>(iii) merry {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
<span>(iv) sleepy {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
{{< /flex>}}

{{< flex gap="1.5rem" flex="initial" >}}
<span>(v) easy {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
<span>(vii) tidy {{< underscored-space>}}  </span>
{{< /flex>}}

{{< /flex>}}

**Ans:**

{{< flex direction="column" gap="1rem" flex="initial" >}}

{{< flex gap="1.5rem" flex="initial" >}}
<span>(i) angry {{< content-box content="angrily">}}  </span>
<span>(ii) happy {{< content-box content="happily">}} </span>
{{< /flex >}}

{{< flex gap="1.5rem" flex="initial" >}}
<span>(iii) merry {{< content-box content="merrily">}} </span>
<span>(iv) sleepy {{< content-box content="sleepily">}} </span>

<span>(v) easy {{< content-box content="easily">}}  </span>
<span>(vii) tidy {{< content-box content="tidily">}}</span>
